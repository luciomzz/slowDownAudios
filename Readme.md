Hi!

If you are here, you probably need to slow down some audios. You are in the right place.

This script is perfect for slowing down Elevenlabs outputs.

This is a compact script that uses pydub (that needs ffmpeg) and sounstretch, which is part of soundtouch.

At the time of writing, you can install ffmpeg ('essentials' version recommended) from the website https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
You can download the executable of soundstretch from the website https://www.surina.net/soundtouch/download.html
You can install the pydub library with pip.

Make sure you add ffmpeg and soundstretch to your PATH.

Versions: 
ffmpeg version 7.0.1-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev
SoundStretch v2.3.3
pydub v0.25.1
